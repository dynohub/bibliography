# A Bibliography

This repository contains a bibliography of anything I've read that I find interesting. 
As a result it covers a very broad range of material.
I make a very cursory effort to group stuff by topic. 
There's no hard rules about that, except that the top-level topics are listed in the comments at the beginning of the file, and where each topic starts in the bibliography.
For most entries I add a "comment" tag that has a summary of what the article is about, written by me or pulled from the abstract, possibly some comments about the article by me, and sometimes quotes pulled from the article.
For most entries I also add a "category" tag which is just a comma-separated list of things the article addresses. (I'm not sure this is actually useful, but it can't hurt.)
I also sometimes add my own comments at the end of the entry (using the LaTeX convention of a % at the beginning of the comment.) This is mostly for more personal thoughts I had about the article which I wouldn't want to be included with any LaTeX compilation of the bibliography.
(In other words, this is where the juicy sarcastic comments, biting critiques, and dumb blind praise are located.)

Why use bibtex/LaTeX/biber? I thought about this a long time, and decided I wanted this bibliography to be a lifetime pursuit.
As such, I thought it was important that it meet lowest-common-denominator standards for formatting. 
Since I already know LaTeX (as much as I hate to admit that), and bibtex uses a plain text file, and bibtex citations are widely available (you can get them for any article listed in Google Scholar or Google Books), I decided that putting this information into bibtex format would give me a text file that I would always be likely to access no matter what technology comes my way in the future.
Even if LaTex suffers the long painful death it deserves, I could always write some simple script in some current language to yank entries based on tags.
Combining that with Github allows me to edit it from anywhere online (nice, because you never know where you will read something interesting) and at the same time pull local copies to edit with a text editor on my desktop.

It's open source because, hey, I believe in that stuff. And also I'm too cheap to pay for a private github repository.
This project has been going on for over a year now, and I can report that, while other attempts I've made to document my readings have failed miserably, this one has stuck pretty well.

If you stumble across this and find something interesting pop me a note, I'd be interested to know about it.

For compiling notes see "extra-compilation-notes.txt".
Though that is really just some things I needed to remember about how idiotic LaTeX/biber compiles.
I'm pretty sure the bibliogrophy actually DOESN'T compile right now.
I'll fix that one of these days.
