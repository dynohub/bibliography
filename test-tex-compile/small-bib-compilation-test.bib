%Some standard useful vim setup stuff:
% :set lbr
% :set spell
% :set breakindent



% Fields added, not standard bibtex fields:
% comment = this is a comment from me, usually the description of what I want to remember about the thing cited. (I was formerly using "abstract" for this, but that seems inappropriate.)
% category = this is the category of thinking the thing cited falls into. One word, big buckets, separate more than one with commas.  ---Rearrange this file by big categories, (instead of media type, which is basically irrelevant) but this field will let you have more than one for some entries

%Might be nice to add these fields:
% quote = direct quotes from the source you want to remember. put in quote marks, separate more than one with a space
% thought = bigger not-as-specific thoughts tied to the concept in this entry. might be very loosely tied to this concept.

% Um... turns out you don't need to comment stuff in bibtex with a %
% Still, I'm using comments after the entry as a way to add more editorialized comments to an entry. Stuff that isn't in the entry itself, but is just my thoughts about it,

% one of the items in the category tag should be which section it is in from the above list. Otherwise, how would I ever pull a whole section?
% all items in the category tag should be lowercase, except CUP. I've lowercased everything down to the ULURP section I believe. The section tag should have the same capitalization as the section header

  comment={In night photos from space, Belgium shines out with a brightly defined outline of the country because it has a densly packed road network with streetlamps left on all night long. This includes rural roads. Most countries do not light rural roads, or turn the lights off during low-traffic hours.},
