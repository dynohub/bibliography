%Some standard useful vim setup stuff:
% :set lbr
% :set spell
% :set breakindent



% Fields added, not standard bibtex fields:
% comment = this is a comment from me, usually the description of what I want to remember about the thing cited. (I was formerly using "abstract" for this, but that seems inappropriate.)
% category = this is the category of thinking the thing cited falls into. One word, big buckets, separate more than one with commas.  ---Rearrange this file by big categories, (instead of media type, which is basically irrelevant) but this field will let you have more than one for some entries

%Might be nice to add these fields:
% quote = direct quotes from the source you want to remember. put in quote marks, separate more than one with a space
% thought = bigger not-as-specific thoughts tied to the concept in this entry. might be very loosely tied to this concept.

% Um... turns out you don't need to comment stuff in bibtex with a %
% Still, I'm using comments after the entry as a way to add more editorialized comments to an entry. Stuff that isn't in the entry itself, but is just my thoughts about it,

% all items in the category tag should be lowercase, except CUP. I've lowercased everything down to the ULURP section I believe. The section tag should have the same capitalization as the section header

  comment={In night photos from space, Belgium shines out with a brightly defined outline of the country because it has a densly packed road network with streetlamps left on all night long. This includes rural roads. Most countries do not light rural roads, or turn the lights off during low-traffic hours.},

% Check out this interview with Caro about The Power Broker: \url{http://gothamist.com/2016/02/17/robert_caro_author_interview.php} Particularly note his comment about Trump. And that he sees writing about Moses as a way to talk about how power works - particularly unelected power - in cities everywhere.
% From the NYPL display, by (presumably) Robert Caro of Moses' Slum Clearance brochures: ``Moses was a real artist. He put a lot of work into brochures he made to illustrate his proposals. And they are totally convincing. The main purpose was to show people how beautiful his projects were going to be. He would give them to the City Council members and the mayors to gain their support, even though some of his plans were problematic. In the Slum Clearance brochures, a lot of these places weren't slums. It was a surprise to the residents, who woke up to find they were being evicted.''
