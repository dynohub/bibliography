- Compiling biblatex is really dumb:
pdflatex .tex file
biber [the file name without an extension]
pdflatex .tex file, again! (maybe one more time for good measure.)

- Have to include the hyperref package in your .tex file for urls to render properly.
It looks like I have to additionally put the URLs inside \url to render properly in pdflatex.

- you have to do \usepackage[biblatex] in your .tex file as well in order to switch to biblatex and get more modern formatting.
