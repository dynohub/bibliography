\usepackage{hyperref} % This is necessary to format urls correctly
%% Define a new 'leo' style for the package that will use a smaller font.
\usepackage[url=true, backend=biber]{biblatex} % Including this line gives you more modern formatting. 
%biber is the more modern backend instead of bibtex. style= is the style you want to use, but 'apa' choked and died.
% This requires you to do:pdflatex -> biber -> pdflatex. See extra-compilation-notes 

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}    % utf8 support       %!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}       % code for pdf file  %!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
% Maybe these lines will get rid of the ascii encoding warning during compilation?

%\bibliographystyle{plain}
% plain-annote is the style that includes annotations.
% Not sure if the above 2 lines work with the biblatex package
\addbibresource{small-bib-compilation-test.bib} %this is probably only going to work with biblatex. with old bibtex you have to use:
