- Compiling biblatex is really dumb:
pdflatex .tex file
biber .aux file
pdflatex .tex file, again! (maybe one more time for good measure.)

- Have to include the hyperref package in your .tex file for urls to render properly.

- Use biber not bibtex in order to get more modern (you know, like newer than 1999) handling of urls as part of article citations.
