%Some standard useful vim setup stuff:
% :set lbr
% :set spell
% :set breakindent



% Fields added, not standard bibtex fields:
% comment = this is a comment from me, usually the description of what I want to remember about the thing cited. (I was formerly using "abstract" for this, but that seems inappropriate.)
% category = this is the category of thinking the thing cited falls into. One word, big buckets, separate more than one with commas.  ---Rearrange this file by big categories, (instead of media type, which is basically irrelevant) but this field will let you have more than one for some entries

%Might be nice to add these fields:
% quote = direct quotes from the source you want to remember. put in quote marks, separate more than one with a space
% thought = bigger not-as-specific thoughts tied to the concept in this entry. might be very loosely tied to this concept.

% Um... turns out you don't need to comment stuff in bibtex with a %
% Still, I'm using comments after the entry as a way to add more editorialized comments to an entry. Stuff that isn't in the entry itself, but is just my thoughts about it,

% This book has very little to do with the movie.
% The only detail I really remember from this book was something like Bill the Butcher being 8 feet tall and going into battle wielding a pair of cleavers.
% What I really took away from this book, and the point that I think it makes which few appreciate, is that the old west had nothing on 19th Century NYC for violence, corruption, and street battles.
% It's like this violent mold of Americanism that is just as influential as the old west was, but remains more or less forgotten in the popular conciousness.

We examine how this affected public health by pairing annual mortality data for over 600 registration districts, spanning 1869 to 1910, with detailed waterworks information. Identification is aided by both institutional hurdles and idiosyncratic delays in the municipalisation process. Municipalisation lowered deaths from typhoid fever, a waterborne disease, by nearly 20% but deaths from non-waterborne causes were unaffected. Results are also robust to the adoption of several strategies that control for the possibility of mean reversion and other potential confounds.},

  author={Applebaum, Anne},
  year={2003},
  publisher={Doubleday Books},
  comment={An in-depth look at the effects of the GULAG on the prisoners in it.},
}
% See photo: ``By changing nature, man changes himself'' of a woman with a jackhammer working on the White Sea Canal 
% This book is 600 pages of listings of the minutia of daily life of the GULAG prisoners. Written in the modern academic style it is edited for content not at all, and not written in a way that tells any kind of story.
% It does HINT at what could be an amazing book: documenting the effort at total top-down control of an economy, making heavy use of this mechanism of the GULAG. How at the top they continually kept trying to tweak the GULAG to work better, and instead managed to make it worse at the bottom, with the expected declining output overall.
% ``Another form of torture specific to the islands, mentioned in both archives and memoirs, was to be sent ``to the mosquitoes.'' Kinger, a White Army officer who later made one of the few successful escapes from Solovetsky, wrote that he once saw this torture inflicted on a prisoner who complained because a parcel sent to him from home had been requisitioned. Angry prison guards responded by removing all his clothes, including his underwear, and tying him to a post in the forest, which was, in the northern summer, swarming with mosquitoes. ``Within half an hour, his whole unlucky body was covered with swelling bites,'' wrote Klinger. Eventually, the man fainted from the pain and loss of blood.'' - Page 24
% ``Mussolini once said of Lenin that he ``is an artist who has worked in men as others have worked in marble or metal.'' This description may be better applied to Stalin, who literally enjoyed the sight of large numbers of human bodies, marching or dancing in perfect synchronization. He was captivated by ballet, by orchestrated exhibitions of gymnastics, and by parades featuring giant pyramids built out of anonymous, contorted human figures. Like Hitler, Stalin was also obsessed with cinema, particularly Hollywood musicals, with their enormous casts of coordinated singers and dancers. He might have derived a different but related form of pleasure from the vast teams of prisoners who dug canals and build railway lines at his bidding.'' - Page 53
% Chapter 4, on the White Sea Canal, is pretty good. But the White Sea Canal, dug by hand with primitive tools at great cost in both money and human life was again replaced by the railroad, just like the Erie Canal and other US canals. Canals were a technological fad of the 19th into 20th centuries. People with more foresight may have seen their inevitable demise.
% On pages 213-215 there is a lovely description of how the awful black bread became sacred, and the rituals that arose around it. There's a nice description of how if you are starving you need to eat your food slowly, but all at once in about half an hour. It isn't good to stretch it out over the course of the day. 
% Since crossing the tundra or the taiga means days of traveling with little or no food, some prisoners would plan their escape with a extra person, preferably a fat person, who they would call ``the meat'' or ``the walking supply.'' The meat of course would be killed and eaten when food supplies ran low. - Page 398
% Description of, and doubts about the book The Long Walk - it may just be a retelling of Rudyard Kipling's short story The Man Who Was. (Which makes sense in the context of other parts of this chapter which talks about how people who could tell a really good story could use that as a way to get extra food and supplies from other prisoners. Story telling was an extremely valued commodity. Maybe The Long Walk is a prison-story-told version of The Man Who Was?) Page 399
% The story of how Beria almost immediately after the death of Stalin started the first wave of amnesty for prisoners. Perhaps because nobody knew better than he how abusive and uneconmical the prison system was. Page 480
